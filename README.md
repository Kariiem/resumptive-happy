## Build Instructions

Happy is built using Cabal.  First install GHC, then:
```
  $ cabal install
```
If you obtained the development version from https://github.com/simonmar/happy/,
install via:
```
  $ make sdist && cabal install
```

Complete documentation can be found in the directory 'doc', in
DocBook XML format.  To format the documentation, the DocBook-Tools
suite (see https://github.com/docbook/wiki/wiki/DocBookTools)
provides all the bits & pieces you need.  Alternatively, pre-formatted
documentation is available from Happy's homepage (URL above).

The directory 'examples' contains some example parsers that use Happy.
