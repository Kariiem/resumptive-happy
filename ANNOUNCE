ANNOUNCING  Happy 1.11  - The LALR(1) Parser Generator for Haskell
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm pleased to announce version 1.11 of Happy, the parser generator
system for Haskell.  This is a minor update from version 1.10, with

	- a bugfix for using Happy with GHC on 64-bit platforms
	- a minor change to the way that precedence parsing is handled: 
	  tokens no longer have a default precedence.

Happy is available in source form, which can be compiled with GHC
version 4.xx (4.08+ recommended), and we also provide binaries for
some architectures.  The Happy homepage with links to the various
distributions lives at:

	http://www.haskell.org/happy/

Please send any bug reports and comments to simonmar@microsoft.com.
